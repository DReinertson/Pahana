      <h2>Welcome to Pahana Farms</h2>
      <p>Near the old cannery town of Haiku, nestled on the northwestern slope of the dormant volcano Haleakala, lies Pahana Farms, an expansive 4-acre private oceanfront property overlooking Maui’s spectacular north shore.  Conveniently situated 20 miles from Kahului International Airport, Pahana’s grounds and facilities provide the ultimate venue for romantic getaways, weddings, honeymoons, and family and corporate retreats.</p>
      <p>In and around Pahana you will find beaches, waterfalls, popular surfing and kiteboarding spots, shops, Hawaiian art galleries, golf courses, the historic towns of Paia and Makawao, Maui flower farms and the famed Road to Hana. Passing showers bring the added pleasure of world-class rainbows.</p>
      <p>Pahana is a one-hour drive from the spectacular Haleakala volcano summit, one and a half hours from Hana, 50  minutes from the old whaling town of Lahaina, and 40 minutes from Wailea/Makena.

        And the best part is, you have the place all to yourself.</p>
